# Purpose: To be a simple script to run after uninstalling packages to clean the dependencies or wanting to 
# clean portages left over ebuilds from previous emerges. There is a couple extra handy things like emptying 
# the trash, cleaning /var/tmp and /tmp, checks the system for compliance with Gentoo Linux Security 
# Advisories and so forth.
